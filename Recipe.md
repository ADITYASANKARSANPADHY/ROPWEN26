Instructions
Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Butter a 9-inch cake tin with parchment paper and brush it with oil or butter.
In a larger bowl, whisk together olive oil, milk, egg, and vanilla for 5 – 6 minutes or until oil and milk are nicely emulsified. Set aside.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Mix nicely.
Pour liquid ingredients into the dry flour mix. Combine nicely using a spatula to form a smooth, lump-free batter.
Add chopped strawberries and gently fold them into the batter.
Pour the batter in the greased cake tin. Arrange sliced strawberries on top of the batter. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sugar over berries.
Bake for 50 minutes to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in a wire rack completely before serving.
Cut into slice and serve Strawberry Cake with cream along with a cup of coffee.

Recipe Notes:
Make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature before preparing the batter. 
Measure all the ingredients correctly. 
Do not over mix the cake batter. Mixing for too long is not going to give you a soft cake. It does quite the opposite. 
Always perform the toothpick test before deciding if the cake is ready. 
While baking with berries always keep in mind, that the skin of the berry may be particularly tart but it might be juicy and sweet from inside. Hence, taste the berry first and then adjust the amount of sugar in the batter accordingly.
Allow the cake to cool down completely on a wire rack before icing or serving.
